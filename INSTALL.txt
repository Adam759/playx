Installation
------------

Copy the "PlayX" folder into your Gmod "addons" folder to install PlayX.
That's all!

PlayX can be used from the tool menu, under the "Options" tab.

Extras
------

Inside the contrib/ folder are some extra extensions for PlayX. They
can be put into your lua/autorun/server/ folder of your Gmod
installation. You can also put them into the lua/autorun/server/ folder
of the PlayX addon.

- playx_faves.lua
  This lets you set some favorite media that can be played via a chat
  command. Open up the file in Notepad (or your favorite text editor)
  for more information.

- playx_media_query.lua
  This extension allows you to control PlayX, as well as search YouTube,
  from chat. Anyone can invoke the YouTube functions, but only those
  permitted to do so can control PlayX.
 
  Chat commands:
    !yt <query> -  Search YouTube in-game for embeddable videos, and get
       the first result (it will not play, though)
    !ytplay [query] - Search YouTube, and play it as well, but if you do
       not provide an argument/search query, then the last found video
       (via !yt or so) will be played
    !ytlisten [query] - Works just like !ytplay, except it will put videos
       into low frame rate mode (for music-only videos)
    !ytlast - Plays the last found video
    !play <URI> - Plays a piece of media (provider is auto-detected)
    !link <URI> - Alias of !play
    !playx <URI> - Alias of !play
  
  In addition to that, a user can also just paste a YouTube URL anywhere
  in his or her message and the title of the video will be looked up and
  printed to chat. It will also set the "last result" as the URL, so you
  can then just do !ytplay, !ytliste, or !ytlast.
