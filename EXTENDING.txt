Providers
---------

Providers are the video services/types themselves, such as YouTube or
Vimeo, or MP3 and FLV files. Registered providers must provide an
auto-detect function, as well as a function to translate a piece of media
into the correct handler (explained later) to play it.

Providers are registered in the PlayX.Providers table. See
playx/providers.lua to see the format of providers.

While providers are defined mostly server-side, there is also a client-side
list of providers. This list, however, does not have any logic. It merely
is a list of available providers. The client-side list of providers can
also be changed, although you would have to either modify PlayX directly,
or download another Lua file. The client-side list of providers is found 
n playx/client/providers.lua.

Handlers
--------

Handlers are a client-side construct. They are the actual players of the
media. They generate HTML for the web browser control in order to play a
piece of media.

There is not a 1:1 relationship between providers and handlers. Many 
different providers can be played using an already-implemented handler.
Handlers are defined in playx/client/providers.lua.

Authorization
-------------

To override authorization, define a global function named
PlayXIsPermittedHook that takes in one argument, a Player. Have it return
true to permit access, and false to deny access.
